# Business Problem 
It is important to understand our main objective which is to develop a model that can assess the sentiment of tweets solely based on their content. To address this, weâ€™re using a dataset from CrowdFlower, which includes more than 9,000 tweets about Apple and Google products. These tweets have been labeled by human raters as positive, negative, or neutral, providing a foundation for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to classify sentiment accurately.
